## ðŸŽ¨ About Me

Iâ€™m Jagathishwaran M, an aspiring 3D Artist & Animator specializing in Blender-driven pipelines. I bring strong technical problemâ€‘solving and scripting skills to every art project. My workflow spans:

- **Procedural Modeling & Geometry Nodes**  
  Rapid, nonâ€‘destructive asset creation: environments (buildings, sciâ€‘fi corridors), props (snowman, donuts, billboards), and dynamic scenes (meteor apocalypse).

- **Character Pipelines**  
  Endâ€‘toâ€‘end character work:UV unwrapping, rigging (FK/IK & facial), and animation cycles.

- **Python & Automation**  
  Blenderâ€¯Python API scripts for batch renders, naming conventions, asset generators, and streamlined export.

- **AIâ€‘Assisted Art**  
  Integrating AI tools to jumpâ€‘start concepts and base meshes, refined in Blender for production quality.

- **Video & Postâ€‘Production**  
  Desktop: Adobeâ€¯Premiereâ€¯Pro, Filmora â”‚ Mobile: CapCut, VN Editor â”‚ Nodeâ€‘based workflows(Node editor).

- **Realâ€‘Time Engines**  
  Importing and configuring assets in Godot, with lightweight GDScript for scene assembly and simple game logic.
